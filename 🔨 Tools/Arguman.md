### Description

Arguman.org is an open-source argument analysis and mapping platform. It allows users to assert contentions, support or refute them, and argue with premises using "because," "but," or "however" conjunctions. The platform aims to promote critical thinking by visually mapping arguments in a hierarchical structure. Arguman is developed by a community of contributors and is designed to facilitate the intellectual process of evaluating information and reasoning.

The platform is implemented using Python and Django, and it offers various installation methods including Docker, Vagrant, and manual installation. Users can contribute to the project by following the contributing guidelines provided in the documentation.
