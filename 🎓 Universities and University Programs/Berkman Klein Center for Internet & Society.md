# Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society

## Description

The Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society is a research center at Harvard University focused on studying cyberspace. Founded in 1996 as the "Center on Law and Technology" at Harvard Law School, it was elevated to an interfaculty initiative of Harvard University in 2008. The center examines how Internet-related technologies are influenced by social context and how they, in turn, affect society. It aims to use research findings to inform Internet-related law design and pioneer Internet development.
