### Works On
The Collective Intelligence Project (CIP) is focused on solving the Transformative Technology Trilemma through governance R&D. It aims to develop collective intelligence capabilities for better decision-making processes and institutions that can handle transformative technologies like AI, bioengineering, and blockchain. CIP emphasizes value elicitation and remaking technology institutions to align technological development with collective values.
