### Description

Digital identity systems conceived through a pluralistic approach refer to systems that securely establish and protect identities by harnessing the inherently social nature of identity. They rely on the rich web of shared histories, interactions, and attributes that exist between an individual and their social connections, such as friends, family, colleagues, and institutions. This "sociometric" data, which encompasses location, communication, actions, personality traits, and more, can comprehensively verify an individual's identity in a redundant, secure, and privacy-preserving manner

Such identity systems aim to enable progressive authentication, where a wide range of confidence in an identity can be achieved by drawing upon multiple trusted attribute issuers. They also prioritize the protection of "contextual integrity," ensuring that personal information remains within the appropriate social contexts.

Digital identity is deeply intertwined with the freedom of association, as it seeks to empower social groups to maintain their collective norms around personal information.
