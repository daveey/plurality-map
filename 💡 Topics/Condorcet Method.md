# Condorcet Method

### Key Resources

### Definition

A Condorcet method is an election method that elects the candidate who wins a majority of the vote in every head-to-head election against each of the other candidates, whenever there is such a candidate. This candidate is known as the Condorcet winner. 

Basic Procedure:

1. **Voting**: Voters rank the list of candidates in order of preference.
2. **Finding the Winner**: The count is conducted by comparing each candidate head-to-head against each other candidate in a series of hypothetical one-on-one contests. The winner of each pairing is the candidate preferred by a majority of voters.
3. **Pairwise Counting and Matrices**: Each pairing of candidates results in pairwise counts indicating how many voters prefer one candidate over the other. These counts are summarized in a pairwise comparison matrix.
