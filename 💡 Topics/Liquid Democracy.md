### Key Resources

Liquid democracy is a form of governance that combines elements of direct and representative democracy. It allows voters to either vote directly on issues or delegate their voting power to representatives on an issue-by-issue basis. This flexibility aims to leverage expertise while maintaining broad participation. Voters can participate directly or choose representatives, delegation is dynamic and can change between issues, and representatives can re-delegate, creating "delegation chains".
