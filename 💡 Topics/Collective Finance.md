### Description

Collective finance encompasses alternative financial systems that prioritize social context, community values, and diverse forms of value exchange over traditional centralized currencies and market structures. These systems include community currencies, shared asset ownership, interpersonal credit networks, and participatory budgeting mechanisms designed to foster local economic activity, social cohesion, and commitment to place. Collective finance envisions a shift from viewing money solely as a fungible currency to recognizing the importance of social context, trust, and diverse forms of value exchange. Alternative financial systems like community currencies, interpersonal debt and trust networks, and using social capital as currency are seen as ways to foster local economic activity, social cohesion, and community values.
