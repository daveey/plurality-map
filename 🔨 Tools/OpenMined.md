### Description

OpenMined is building software that makes it possible for one person to answer a question using data owned by another, without ever seeing or acquiring a copy of that data. OpenMined calls this process Remote Data Science. The advent of remote data science means that, in a huge variety of domains across society, current tradeoffs between sharing data and protecting that data will be broken.
