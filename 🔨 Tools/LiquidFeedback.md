### Description

LiquidFeedback is free software for political opinion formation and decision making, combining aspects of representative and direct democracy. A distinguishing feature is the implementation of a delegated voting system -- [[liquid democracy]] --which is to establish a new form of political representation and participation that takes into account the knowledge disparity of its participants. It helps groups make decisions without the limitations of traditional Internet forums and aims to create an accurate representation of the opinions held by the members.
