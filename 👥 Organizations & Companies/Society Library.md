### Works On

The Society Library extracts arguments, claims, and evidence from various forms of media to compile databases which represent the ideas and arguments from all points of view starting with the most high-impact, persistent, and polarizing issues; to be visualized and made freely available to the public in a library. The long-term vision of the Society Library is to create a library of ideas not only on social and political subjects, but also philosophy, spirituality, and social values.
