### Description

Historically, voting has been used as a way for groups to make collective decisions and avoid violent conflict. The most common form of voting today is plurality rule, where each member of a community selects one option and the option with the most votes wins. However, this system has several drawbacks, such as the "tyranny of the majority" and the "lesser of two evils" dynamic. To address these issues, various alternative voting systems have been developed, including:

- Ranked choice and approval voting, which allow voters to express preferences for multiple candidates.
- Weighted voting, where voters are given different numbers of votes based on factors like shareholding or population size.
- Federal, proportional, and consociational representation, which aim to protect minority groups from oppression by the majority.

However, these systems still have limitations and can be rigid or haphazard in their design. More recently, innovations like quadratic voting (QV) and liquid democracy (LD) have emerged as potential solutions. QV allows voters to express the strength of their preferences by buying additional votes at a quadratic cost, while LD enables voters to delegate their votes to others in a fluid manner.

Other relevant areas of research in contemporary voting systems include:

- Correlation discounting and eigenvoting, which account for social connections and underlying factors driving coordination among voters.
- Adaptive representation based on current social divides rather than fixed geographic boundaries.
- Predictive voting, which combines voting with prediction markets.
- Quadratic liquid democracy, which applies QV principles to LD systems.
