### Description

Collaborative civic technology is an approach to leveraging digital tools and platforms to facilitate citizen engagement, participation, and collaboration in addressing societal challenges and improving governance. It is characterized by a bottom-up, citizen-led model that emphasizes the potential for individuals and communities to directly shape technological solutions for civic issues. Collaborative civic technology projects are often problem-oriented, driven by diverse groups of stakeholders working together to create effective solutions using open-source software and open data. This approach ensures transparency, encourages participation, and enables the adaptation and replication of solutions across different contexts. By serving as a bridge between citizens and government, collaborative civic technology fosters a more participatory, responsive, and innovative approach to governance, harnessing the collective intelligence and resources of citizens to enhance democratic processes, increase government transparency and accountability, and develop more effective solutions to complex societal challenges.
