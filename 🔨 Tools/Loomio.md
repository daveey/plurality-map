### Description

Loomio is decision-making software designed to assist groups with collaborative, consensus-focused decision-making processes. Loomio facilitates conversations and decision-making processes from starting discussions to reaching outcomes. Loomio emerged from the Occupy movement in New Zealand. It was built by a small core group of developers in Wellington, with contributions from over 70 participants globally. Initially launched in 2012, Loomio raised over $100,000 via crowdfunding to develop Loomio 1.0. Since then, Loomio has been translated into 35 languages and used in more than 100 countries.

Loomio's organizational structure is based on groups, which can be public or private. Within these groups, members create discussions and proposals. Proposals can solicit feedback through options like agree, disagree, abstain, or block. Loomio's interface supports mobile access and other enhancements.
