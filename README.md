# Plurality Mapping Project
➡️ [Github](https://github.com/daveey/plurality-map)

## Purpose

This project aims to create a comprehensive map of the Plurality ecosystem - organizations, projects, and initiatives rethinking how human collaboration happens at scale. It serves as a key infrastructure and resource for the Plurality community. 

We strive to balance depth with breadth, providing a resource that highlights key players and ideas while also showcasing the field's diversity.

## Scope

Our scope is intentionally broad, encompassing:
- Organizations directly working on Plurality concepts
- Projects related to rethinking collaboration and governance
- Initiatives using technology to reimagine resource distribution
- Other efforts that contribute to or intersect with plurality goals

While some entries may be more "canonically" Plurality-focused than others, we aim to capture the full breadth of this emerging field.

## Ownership and Contributions

The Plurality Institute is stewarding this resource, but it's intended as a community asset. We welcome and encourage contributions from the broader Plurality community. This is an open, collaborative project that will grow and evolve with your input.

## Prioritization

Rather than strictly defining what's in or out of scope, we focus on prioritizing entries most relevant and useful to the Plurality community. Higher priority is given to projects and organizations frequently referenced or connected within the ecosystem.

## Goals

- Provide a comprehensive overview of the Plurality field
- Help people discover relevant organizations and projects
- Facilitate connections within the Plurality ecosystem
- Serve as a reference point for newcomers and established members alike

## Current Status

This map is an evolving resource. We plan iterative improvements based on community feedback and the rapidly changing landscape of Plurality work.
