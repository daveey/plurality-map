### Description

Deliberation and sense-making are interconnected processes that enable individuals and communities to navigate complex societal challenges and arrive at collective decisions while embracing diversity.

Deliberation involves inclusive discussion and consideration of various perspectives to gain deeper understanding. It has traditionally occurred through in-person conversations, writing, and representative processes like elections, sortition, or administration. However, there is a fundamental trade-off between the diversity of perspectives and the bandwidth of communication.

Sense-making, on the other hand, roughly refers to the process of creating meaning from complex or contradictory information. 

For example, bridging systems like Polis and Community Notes enable large-scale participation while surfacing areas of consensus and productive disagreement. They combine the interactive nature of social media with features that encourage thoughtful listening. And Platforms like Cortico's Fora allow insights from in-person deliberations to be shared more widely while protecting privacy. Other AI techniques help organize existing media content to highlight the contours of debate.
